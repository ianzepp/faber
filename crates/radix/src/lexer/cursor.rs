//! UTF-8 cursor for lexer-owned source traversal.
//!
//! The cursor is the narrow abstraction that lets token scanners reason in
//! Unicode scalar values while spans remain byte offsets into the original
//! source buffer. It deliberately does not classify tokens, normalize text, or
//! collect diagnostics; it only advances through valid UTF-8 boundaries and
//! exposes small lookahead primitives.
//!
//! INVARIANTS
//! ==========
//! - `pos` is always the byte offset of the next character to read.
//! - `chars` is always positioned at `source[pos..]`.
//! - Offsets returned by this cursor are valid UTF-8 boundaries and can be fed
//!   back into [`Cursor::slice`].
//!
//! TRADE-OFFS
//! ==========
//! Lookahead clones the standard `Chars` iterator instead of maintaining a
//! side buffer. The lexer only needs one- and two-character lookahead today, so
//! cloning keeps cursor state simple while preserving zero-copy source slices.
